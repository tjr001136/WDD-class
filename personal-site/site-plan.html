      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is to help students who have difficulty in
        each subject. The website will connect tutors with students in need to
        help them directly.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The people who visit my website will be students who fall behind in
        their studies or tutors who want to help those students. I think many
        tutors will also be interested because they will receive a certain
        amount of tuition from students. Students will also be interested in
        cheaper prices than traditional personal tutoring.

        [Most students are very interested in academic performance. In fact,
        good academic performance can provide them with a better future and a
        better job. Therefore, many students will make great efforts to improve
        their academic performance. However, while some students grow up well on
        their own, others cannot study on their own without someone's help. I
        made this website for these students. The website is designed to allow
        students with poor academic performance to learn many things from
        tutors. Tutors are also made up of students of similar ages, which will
        bring familiarity to students. Tutors will be guaranteed some revenue.
        There will be more profit than just working part-time. Also, I think you
        will feel satisfied by the achievements of other students. I'm sure many
        students will ask questions about how to find a tutor. It will identify
        individual requirements through the survey and then connect the tutor
        and the student directly. Students will be able to find the right tutor
        for them as soon as possible by simply entering a few short questions
        and simple personal information.]

        want to study and what types of tutors they want. Therefore, students
        can choose and study tutors according to their preferences.]
